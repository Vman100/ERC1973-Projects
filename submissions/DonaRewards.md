# Description of the Project 

An application for rewarding donators with reward tokens.

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

Donators need incentives to donate as early investers with large contributions.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

As the number of donators grows rapidly, functions of ERC 1973 can utilized to ease distrubtion to a very large number of donators via millstones or timed triggers.
The pull mechanic would allow the donators to retrieve their rowards when ready.
