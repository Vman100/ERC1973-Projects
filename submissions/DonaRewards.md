# Description of the Project 

An application for rewarding contributors with reward tokens.

# Problem specification related to ERC 1973

contributors need incentives to donate as early investors with large contributions. The tokens could be used as reward points that are redeemed for products or discounts at events, for services, or as a way of gaining access to perks. those a large sum of token would be able to obtain more premium products or higher perks along with access to large discounts.

# Solution in relation to ERC 1973 

As the number of contributors grows rapidly, functions of ERC 1973 can utilized to ease distribution to a very large number of contributors via millstones or timed triggers.the millstones or timed triggers would act points when new tokens are minted in which few contributors with large contributions would result in a large amount of tokens per contributor. the timed triggers could be configured to align with the timing of special events or points in time when new tokens are minted.
The pull mechanic would allow the contributors to retrieve their rewards when ready without causing bottlenecks in the network.
